  <brief># to divide the NOMINAL_CLOCK_FREQ by before passing it to the PWM peripheral.</brief>
  <doc>gpio frames per second is a product of the nominal clock frequency divided by BITS_PER_CLOCK and divided again by CLOCK_DIV
At 500,000 frames/sec, memory bandwidth does not appear to be an issue (jitter of -1 to +2 uS)
attempting 1,000,000 frames/sec results in an actual 800,000 frames/sec, though with a lot of jitter.
Note that these numbers might vary with heavy network or usb usage.
eg at 500,000 fps, with 1MB/sec network download, jitter is -1 to +30 uS
at 250,000 fps, with 1MB/sec network download, jitter is only -3 to +3 uS</doc>
